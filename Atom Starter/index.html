      <h3>
        A HISTORY BY ALBUM RELEASES
      </h3>
      <p id="tribute-info">
        John Mayer is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and record producer.
        <br>
        <br>
        We will be exploring Mayer's music through a few of his notable albums starting with the acoustic <i>Inside Wants Out</i> and ending with a more recent single, <i>I Guess I Just Feel Like</i>.
      </p>

      <h3>
        INSIDE WANTS OUT
      </h3>
      <p>
        (1999)
      </p>
      <img src="/img/inwaou.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        An album that would later be defined by - and appreciated for - its entirely acoustic approach and lack of overall "major label" polish, <i>Inside</i> offers a glimpse into both the process behind his songwriting and what his tracks 
        might sound like before hitting the studio.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although most of the songs on this record would go on to be re-recorded for <i>Room for Squares</i>, Mayer shows us that he needs nothing more than an acoustic guitar to demonstrate his songwriting talents, knack for melody making and sheer playing ability.
        <br>
        <br>
        Highlights: Neon. And for being the closest thing Mayer fans have to an "Unplugged" album.
      </p>

      <h3>
        CONTINUUM
      </h3>
      <p>
        (2006)
      </p>
      <img src="/img/continuum.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Perhaps not quite the clean break from his usual pop-rock that fans of the blues and of Mayers guitar playing talents would have wanted, <i>Continuum</i> was still, sonically, a marked change in his musical style.
        <br>
        <br>
        Employing a vast array of talent, with none other than <i>Pino Palladino</i> (bass, production) and <i>Steve Jordan</i> (drums, percussion, vocals, production) as primary members of both his studio and touring band, Mayer manages to craft an album that incorporates elements of blues, soul, funk, r&b and folk with his guitar playing at the forefront of it all. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Does he hit every note in terms of fulfilling his appreciation for so many genres? Not really, but I like that he tried.
        <br>
        <br>
        Highlights: Gravity, Belief, Slow Dancing in a Burning Room, Vultures.
      </p>

      <h3>
        BATTLE STUDIES
      </h3>
      <p>
        (2009)
      </p>
      <img src="/img/battlestudies.jpg" alt="">
      <p>
        It's generally understood that, after the success of Continuum, Mayer was anxious about recording new material but did not want the "creative juices" to stop flowing before he got to work on another album.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thus, <i>Battle Studies</i> is a result of riding the vertigo-inducing high of a near chart-topping album, described as "pop for grown ups", Mayers ego was at an all-time high. I'm tired of writing. How are these albums over 10 years old?
        <br>
        <br>
        Mayer must have been onto something because this album topped the <i>Billboard 200</i> and sold lots of copies.
        <br>
        <br>
        Highlights: Perfectly Lonely, Crossroads, Edge of Desire.

        <h3>
          I GUESS I JUST FEEL LIKE
        </h3>
        <p>
          (2019)
        </p>
        <img src="/img/iguess.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
          We end up going full circle with the release of <i>I Guess</i>.
          <br>
          On his Instagram, Mayer shares with us: 
          "I was thinking with my ultra-aesthetic brain, trying to write the tune I thought would be cool to have via sequencers, plugins and effects.(That process has worked barely enough times to still make it justifiable.) 
          <br>
          <br>
          Then one day in October I decided I’d had just about enough of myself, 
          and that’s always when the good stuff starts. I got two inexpensive microphones, a 1” tape machine and took out my Martin D-45 guitar. 
          “I’m just going to do what I do,”"
          <br>
          <br>
          This is, lyrically, the most stripped down version of Mayer since
          <i>Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey...</i>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Highlights: It's nice to know that despite his fame, fortune and 
          status, what works best for him during a difficult time are the things that 
          have always worked: a guitar, and a tape deck.
